This is a complete rebuild of my portfolio using next.js. It's definitely a work in progress. If you see something strange, let me know. You can check my progress [here](https://github.com/MichaelArestad/portfolio/projects/1).

Feel free to fork it and modify it how you like. Other than the content, i's all open source.

Take a peek at the [development readme](https://github.com/MichaelArestad/portfolio/blob/main/DEVELOPMENT.md) for build instructions.
