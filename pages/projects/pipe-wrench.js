								Pipe Wrench needs a balance of type that allows the content to
								be both bold and poetic. In order to accomplish this, I needed
								massive a massive display typeface and an elegant body copy
								typeface.
							</Text>
							<Text>
								For headlines and buttons, I looked for a heavy display typeface
								reminiscent of Russian Constructivist posters, yet not quite as
								agressive.{" "}
								<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Teko">Teko</a> by the
								Indian Type Foundry fit this bill. When it is all caps, it has
								some massive IMPACT.
							</Text>
							<Text>
								For body copy, I looked for an elegant typeface with a larger
								x-height that contrasts with Teko.{" "}
								<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bitter">Bitter</a> by
								Argentinian type foundry , Huerta Tipogr√°fica, paired nicely and
								has quite the range of styles and weights. &lt;3

							<Text>
								I took advantage of the editor's super powers and took extra
								care to ensure that when folks are editing content, it looks as
								close to possible as what is rendered on the front end. This
								makes it so much faster to compose interesting layouts and
								designs without having to preview every change. Below, you can
								see an image of a post in the editor and a second image of the
								post once published.
